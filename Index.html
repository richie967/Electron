        <h3><span>Our Vision</span><br>a truly sustainable regional air mobility network.</h3>
        <p>Currently the global aviation industry is 99.9% reliant on burning fossil fuels producing significant amounts
          of emissions. The future path of global warming heavily depends on Carbon neutral transport systems. Domestic
          air travel in the UK is currently limited to around 40 airports with only a small number of commercially
          viable
          routes.</p>
        <p>The Electron 5 aircraft has ZERO emissions. It&apos;s unique capabilities enable an additional 700 existing
          general aviation airports to be utilised. Combined with an order of magnitude reduction in operating costs
          this
          greatly increases the number of commercially viable routes.</p>

        <p>Existing regional air transport has been struggling to be profitable in recent times due to low profit

          <p>This is a high growth business, we project a sales revenue of &pound;1.1 Billion in 2035 with a potential
            operator revenue of &pound;2 Billion in the UK alone.</p>
          <blockquote>&quot;<i>With just one passenger we can achieve price parity to rail travel in the UK.</i>&quot;
          </blockquote>
          <p>Our initial entry into the market will be private aircraft owners, expanding to air taxi services. <br>The
            demand
            for green modes of transport has grown significantly over the last 10 years. Together with the massive
            decrease in cost of batteries, we believe this is the right time to start manufacturing high efficiency
            electric aircraft.</p>

          <p>Key financial figures include, a base price of &pound;450,000. This is competitive with other 4 seater twin
            or single engine light aircraft with similar range and speed. In summary, our goal is to manufacture,
            certify
            and sell our first aircraft by 2025 (Phase 1-3).</p>
          <p>We are currently seeking investment for Phase 1, a full size prototype propulsion system and a flying scale
            model. We will then quickly advance to Phase 2, demonstrating our vision with a full size flying prototype.
